Votivate Turf Cutter
=================================

This is a proof-of-concept for a turf cutter featuring persistent turf mapping. Technology used: NodeJS, React, Redux, MongoDB, and Google Maps API.

**[See the live demo here.](https://votivate-turf-cutter.herokuapp.com)**

1. Right click to reverse geocode an address on the map (it will center the maker on the address coordinates, and will not allow duplicates).
2. Select the polygon creator tool and draw a polygon over the addresses using points.
3. Notice the address and polygon will match colors â€“ in the databse, the selected addresses will be assigned a turf ID for further querying of voters or supporters (not implemented at this time).
